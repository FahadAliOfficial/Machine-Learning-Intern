Machine Learning Projects I have done as an Intern
This repository contains a collection of five machine learning projects developed as part of the Machine Learning Internship Program at Prodigy InfoTech. Each project addresses a unique problem and employs different machine learning techniques.

Projects
1. House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
Folder: PRODIGY_ML_1

Description: This project predicts house prices using a linear regression model based on square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms.

Dataset: Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques

2. Customer Segmentation Using K-means Clustering
Folder: PRODIGY_ML_2

Description: This project groups retail store customers based on their purchase history using a K-means clustering algorithm.

Dataset: Kaggle Customer Segmentation Tutorial

3. Cat and Dog Image Classification Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Folder: PRODIGY_ML_3

Description: This project classifies images of cats and dogs using a Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Dataset: Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats

4. Hand Gesture Recognition Using Deep Learning
Folder: PRODIGY_ML_4

Description: This project develops a hand gesture recognition model that can accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data, enabling intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems.

Dataset: Kaggle Leap Gestures Dataset

5. Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation
Folder: PRODIGY_ML_5

Description: This project develops a model that can accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content, enabling users to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices.

Dataset: Kaggle Food-101

Project Structure
Each project folder contains:

dataset/: Contains the dataset files relevant to the project.
project_notebook.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with the complete code for data exploration, preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation.
output/: Contains output files such as prediction results or model performance metrics.
README.md: Project-specific description and instructions.
General Usage
To use any of the projects, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-projects.git
Navigate to the project directory:


cd ml-projects/PRODIGY_ML_x  # Replace 'x' with the project number
Install the required dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Open and run the Jupyter notebook:


jupyter notebook project_notebook.ipynb
Check the output/ directory for results and predictions.
