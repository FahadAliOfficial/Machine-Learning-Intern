House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
This project aims to predict house prices using a linear regression model based on square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition.

Dataset
The dataset consists of various features of houses, including their square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The target variable is the sale price of the houses. The dataset is divided into two main parts:

train.csv: The training set, which includes both the features and the target variable (house prices).
test.csv: The test set, which includes only the features. The target variable for this set is what we aim to predict.
Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

dataset/: Contains the dataset files.
train.csv: Training data with features and target variable.
test.csv: Test data with features only.
house_price_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for data exploration, preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation.
y_pred.csv: Output file storing the predictions made by the model on the test dataset.
README.md: Project description and instructions.
Implementation
The project is implemented in the following steps:

Data Exploration: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution of features and the target variable. Visualization techniques are used to identify any patterns or correlations.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Feature engineering may also be performed to create new relevant features.

Model Implementation: Using a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The model is trained on the training dataset and evaluated using appropriate metrics.

Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. Cross-validation techniques may also be employed to ensure the robustness of the model.

Prediction: Making predictions on the test dataset and storing the results in y_pred.csv.
